# Introduction

Most projects on the Coronasafe Network are dockerised and can be easily deployed on various container orchestration services for scalability. This documentation contains instructions for setting up our Care Network project in a production environment on the Kubernetes service provided by Amazon \(AWS EKS\). The same principles can be applied to other projects under Coronasafe Network.

To learn more about CARE, refer to the design document available [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4D9FnR4RcYi4NC696c-2oc3s1_T6Jei-tPTEaxlrd4/edit?usp=sharing). 

For help in setting up a local version of the project for development, see [Setting up the project locally](local.md)
